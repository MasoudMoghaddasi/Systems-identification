# Diagnosis of Epilepsy with EEG Data in Presence of Faulty Channel
For diagnosing the diseases automatically, a device should be created that can classify the sick and healthy people and various diseases. We suggest a way to classify EEG data of healthy and epileptic person. Besides, we examine the case that if there is a problem in one of the signal reception channels, will there be a problem in diagnosing the disease. We try to reconstruct the faulty signal with data obtained from other channels. Then we show that the diagnosis improves after reconstruction.
